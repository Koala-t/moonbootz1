# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you to manage a large and complex code project across many developers in an organized fashion.  In Git, it also allows you to additional info like the history of changes in a given project and who has worked on it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a splitting of a code base so that changes or adjustments can be made and tested before integrating into the original source code.  You would use this to confirm that there are no problems with added features/funtionality and to allow other people to easily review and test the code themselves.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
When you commit a file, you are "officially" saving that revision of the edited file.  Whenever you commit a file you will also add a commit message.  In order to write a good commit message it should be very clear what was added/changed and allow new developers or people to come in and easily understand what was done.


* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict arises when you are trying to merge two files where the exact same lines of code have been changed.  You'll be notified and fix the code before adding and committing.
